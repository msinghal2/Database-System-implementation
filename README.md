# Database-System-implementation
The project is made up of 6 stages that build on top of each other, and follow the path

of a SQL query from the user interface all the way down to the storage, and back through the

relational algebra operators with the result displayed on the user’s screen.

1. Database Catalog 
2. Query Compiler ­ Built using lex (flex) and yacc (bison) 
3. Heap File
4. Relational Algebra Operators 
5. Sorted File and Sort­Based Relational Algebra Operators
6. B+­Tree Index.

The coding was entirely in C/C++ over a Linux environment.

Tested using TPC­H benchmark database.
